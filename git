git add ... to undo "git add" do => git reset
git add --all (adds all modified and unstaged files)
git add docs/*.txt (directoy and file formats to add)

git add "*.txt" (add all the files in the whole project)


Staging and remotes

git diff --staged (view staged difference)

git reset HEAD <filename> (unstage the files ,HEAD refers to last commit,current branch)

git checkout -- <Filename> (blow away all changes since last commit)

git commit -a -m "commit message" (-a add changes from all tracked files,doesn't add new untracked files)

undoing a commit (dont do these after push)
git reset --soft HEAD^ (soft -reset into staging.^ move to
 commit before head i.e last commit)

git reset --hard HEAD^ (undo last commit and all changes .. only if something went horribly )

git reset --hard HEAD^^ (undo last 2 commits and all changes)

sharing coding

git remote add <name> <address>
git remote add origin https://address (add:new remote,origin: our name for this remote(can be any name))

git remote -v (show remote reps)

forgot to add a file in commit
git add <filename>
git commit --amend -m "message" (amend adds to the last commit)


git push -u origin master(origin: remote rep name, master:local branch to push)

git remote rm <name> (remove remotes)

git pull


merging a branch to master
git checkout master
git merge branch_name


Remote branch and tags

git push origin branch_name (pushing your local branch to remote )

git branch -r (to see all the remote branch)

git remote show origin

git push origin :branch_name (to delete the remote branch Note: you will still have local branch)

git branch -d branch_name (delete branch locally ..force delete use capital -D)

If say someone delete the branch and your working on it 
do check

git remote show origin
then
git remote prune origin (to clean up the remote branches)


Tagging
A tag is a reference to a commit(used mostly for release versioning )

git tag (list all tags)

git checkout tag_name (checkout code at commit)

git tag -a tag_name -m "message" (to add new tag)

git push --tags (git push tags)

git checkout tag_name


git commit

git  push

git push origin branch (pushing branch in github)

git pull upstream master(pull latest code from forked master)

git push origin --delete branchname (delete branch from github)


git stash( the point where u want to create or work on other branch without commiting the current branch)

git stash list(to view list of stash)

git stash apply( to apply latest stash)

git stash apply stash@{2} (Specifying stash name) 

git branch -D brachname(deletes branch locally)
